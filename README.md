# <h1 align="center">Weather Dashboard</h1>

I built a weather dashboard that will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS. 

This app uses the OpenWeather API to retrieve weather data and uses localStorage to store persistent data. I designed the app to be fully responsive and have a professional look so it can be easy to navigate.
