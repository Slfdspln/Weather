##  Description 
The aim of this project was to develop a weather dashboard application that allows users to retrieve current and future weather conditions for any city in the world. To achieve this, I utilized my expertise in server-side API calls to extract real-time data and present it to users. The application displays both the current day forecast and a 5-day forecast, with each day represented by a unique weather icon. Temperature (in degrees Fahrenheit), wind (in MPH), and humidity (%) data are also provided. By default, the application loads Austin, TX, as the initial city. Through this project, I gained valuable experience in retrieving data from server-side APIs, using query-parameters when calling APIs, reformatting data for display, and leveraging JavaScript for functionality. Additionally, I learned how to effectively use the materialize CDN framework to create a visually appealing interface with grid layout and button functionality. This project underscored the importance of function reusability in software development.

## Technologies Used

This project utilizes HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Materialize, and OpenWeather API (server-side API).

## Installation

Clone the repo: git clone git@github.com:Slfdspln/weather-board.git

Open in VS Code. If you do not have VS code you must install it.

## Features

This page offers a feature that enables users to load real-time weather data from any chosen city. The displayed data includes current weather conditions and a 5-day forecast. Upon searching for a city, its associated data will be stored in local storage. Subsequently, the recent search buttons can be used to retrieve the stored data instead of fetching it from the API again, thus reducing the API calls.
